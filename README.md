# MetaWear UWP Starter
This project provides a template for creating Universal Windows Platform app with the MetaWear C++ API.  The example code sets up the 
C++ API to be used in a UWP app and handles all the Bluetooth LE functionality; all users need to do is add in their own UI elements 
and MetaWear code.

Both C# and C++/CX examples are provided so pick whichever language you are most comfortable using for building UWP apps.
